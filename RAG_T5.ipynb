Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated re-\\nmarkable abilities in understanding text, which also introduced the\\npotential for more expressive modeling in text-rich graphs. Despite\\nthese capabilities, efficiently applying LLMs to representation learn-\\ning on graphs presents significant challenges. Recently, parameter-\\nefficient fine-tuning methods for LLMs have enabled efficient new\\ntask generalization with minimal time and memory consumption.\\nInspired by this, we introduce Graph-aware Parameter-Efficient\\nFine-Tuning - GPEFT, a novel approach for efficient graph repre-\\nsentation learning with LLMs on text-rich graphs. Specifically, we\\nutilize a graph neural network (GNN) to encode structural infor-\\nmation from neighboring nodes into a graph prompt. This prompt\\nis then inserted at the beginning of the text sequence. To improve\\nthe quality of graph prompts, we pre-trained the GNN to assist the\\nfrozen LLM in predicting the next token in the node text. Compared\\nwith existing joint GNN and LMs, our method directly generates the\\nnode embeddings from large language models with an affordable\\nfine-tuning cost. We validate our approach through comprehen-\\nsive experiments conducted on 8 different text-rich graphs, observ-\\ning an average improvement of 2% in hit@1 and Mean Reciprocal\\nRank (MRR) in link prediction evaluations. Our results demonstrate\\nthe efficacy and efficiency of our model, showing that it can be\\nsmoothly integrated with various large language models, including\\nOPT, LLaMA, and Falcon.\\n∗Work done while being an intern at Amazon.\\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\\nfor profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\\non the first page.

Many of these networks are rich in\\ntextual information on various types of objects, known as text-rich\\nor text-attributed networks. For example, in an e-commerce graph,\\ntext-rich information could be used to predict links by analyzing\\nproduct descriptions, user reviews, and metadata to recommend\\nitems that are frequently bought together. Such real-world applica-\\ntions typify the problem of link prediction, where representation\\nlearning (i.e., embedding) emerges as the most prevalent solution.\\nRepresentation learning on graph-structured data aims to learn\\na dense vector for each node through self-supervised tasks such as\\nlink prediction [9,34,46] or masked attribute recovery [14]. These\\ndense vectors can be widely utilized in various downstream ap-\\nplications including search, ranking, and retrieval. To effectively\\nutilize both node attributes and structural information in represen-\\ntation learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [11,21] devise a\\nnovel type of neural network with a message-passing mechanism.\\nIn text-rich graphs, raw text is usually transformed into feature\\nvectors by a text encoder prior to the application of Graph Neu-\\nral Networks (GNNs). Early text encoders, such as bag-of-words\\nand Word2Vec [32], are being gradually phased out due to signifi-\\ncant improvements in text representation from transformer-based\\nlanguage models (LMs).\\nThis has spurred interest in jointly modeling textual and struc-\\ntural data with GNNs and LMs. Notable architectures include (1)\\na cascading architecture that integrates GNNs with LM features\\n(cascading GNN-LMs); (2) nested GNN-LMs that blend message\\npassing into the language modeling process. Examples of the latter\\ninclude arXiv:2404.18271v1 [cs.CL] 28 Apr 2024\"\\\n",

Considering the\\nreduced parameter storage requirements and the training time, we\\nbelieve GPEFT holds significant potential for industrial-scale ap-\\nplications, including recommendation systems, ranking tasks, and\\netc.\\nRQ5: What is the parameter sensitivity of GPEFT ?\\nThere are several important hyper-parameters in GPEFT : (1)\\nLORA rank 𝑟, it affects the number of trainable parameters (2)\\nnumber of hops 𝑘in GNN prompt encoder, it affects the amount of\\nstructural information used in the training of GPEFT . In Figure 4,\\nwe observe that varying the rank of LoRA matrices from 4 to 32 does\\nnot significantly affect the performance. This observation aligns\\nwith findings from other studies, which suggest that optimizing for\\na single task requires only minor adjustments to the pre-trained\\nLLM weights. Similarly, varying number of hops in the GNN prompt\\nencoder has a minor effect on performance, until the point where\\nmessage passing begins to aggregate more noisy neighbors than\\nuseful ones (e.g., at 4 hops, as shown in Figure 4b).\\n6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\\nThis paper proposes GPEFT to harness LLMs for representation\\nlearning on text-rich graphs. Compared with existing work of ap-\\nplying LLM on graph structure data, our proposed method is the\\nfirst one that generates embeddings from the LLM and therefore can\\nbe applied on numerous industrial applications.

       "\" You are a helpful assistant who tries to answer the question at the end using this information:  'Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Qi Zhu, Da Zheng, Xiang Song, Shichang Zhang, Bowen Jin, Yizhou Sun, and George Karypis\\n(2) In the same tables, we also find GNN (Sentence-BERT) per-\\nform worse than GNN (PEFT-LLaMA). In addition, GraphForm-\\ners also reports subpar performance against GNN (PEFT-LLaMA).\\nTherefore, we conclude that large language models serve as power-\\nful feature encoders for representation learning on text-rich graphs.\\nMeanwhile, InstructGLM outperforms GraphFormers but falls short\\nof PATTON’s performance. This discrepancy may be attributed to\\nthe challenges of handling graph structures through embedding-\\nbased in-context learning, which struggles with accurately cap-\\nturing structures via natural language descriptions. Consequently,\\ncarefully fine-tuned GNN-LMs ( GPEFT and PATTON) tend to sur-\\npass the embeddings produced by black-box LLMs.\\n(3)GPEFT consistently outperforms the compared baseline across\\nboth metrics. Specifically, it surpasses PEFT-LLaMA by 2.6% and\\n1.8% on MAG and Amazon Reviews, respectively, in terms of hit@1.\\nCompared to its own ablation, we find that pre-training helps im-\\nprove the accuracy of link prediction, especially in the academic\\ntext-rich graph.\\nRQ2: Is the pre-training of the graph prompt encoder neces-\\nsary?\\nOn MAG, we observe that our approach performs significantly\\nworse (∼6%) without pretraining compared to its pretrained coun-\\nterpart. On Amazon Review, while the performance gap is smaller\\nacross three subdomains, the Video Games category demonstrates\\ninstability without pretraining. Interestingly, Patton also outper-\\nforms GraphFormers with the same architecture on subdomains\\nthat utilize pre-trained checkpoints. Both methods introduce virtual\\nstructural tokens, and employing the same pre-training objective\\nas the pre-trained language model. Apparently, continual training\\nhelps align the virtual token representations with text representa-\\ntions. Therefore, we advocate for a pre-training then fine-tuning\\nparadigm, where one needs to pre-train only once in a domain and\\ncan fine-tune for various applications ( e.g., co-purchase, churn, etc.).\\n5.5 Model Analysis\\nIn this section, we provide more in-depth study to understand\\nperformance and efficiency of GPEFT .\\nRQ3:Can our approach be adapted to different PEFT methods\\nand LLMs?\\n(a) Varying PEFT algorithms\\n (b) Varying backbone LLMs\\nFigure 3: GPEFT using different LLMs and PEFT algorithms\\non Amazon Review.\\nWe first apply prefix tuning [ 24] onGPEFT and demonstrate the\\nresults on four subdomains of Amazon Review in Figure 3a. We\\ncan find that using prefix-tuning or LORA does not show muchTable 5: Time and memory costs of GPEFT on MAG-\\nEconomics using 8 A100 GPUs with a total batch size of 32.\\npre-training fine-tuning inference\\nTime 36min 96min 11min\\nMemory 20883MB 28309MB 13676MB\\n#trainable 5.5M 14.4M -\\ndifference, which indicates the versatility of our framework on\\nvarious PEFT techniques.\\nSecond, we substitute the backbone language model with OPT-\\n1.3B [ 47] and Falcon-7B2. In Figure 3b, we observe that, in general,\\nLLaMA-7B outperforms the others, with Falcon-7B in second place\\nand OPT-1.3B being outperformed by these two models. Our re-\\nsults are consistent with other work that shows LLMs with more\\nparameters yield better performance in downstream applications.\\nRQ4: Is GPEFT efficient in large-scale representation learn-\\ning?\\nIn Table 5, we report the running time of our approach at each\\nphase on MAG-Economics. Specifically, unlike the pre-training\\ntime of PATTON [ 19] (10hr+), the pre-training time of GPEFT is\\neven shorter than the fine-tuning time. Because we only optimize\\nΘ𝑔in the pre-training phase and we can say that the pre-training\\nis both necessary and efficient together with RQ2 . Owing to its\\nparameter-efficient tuning, our approach not only minimizes the\\nnumber of training parameters but also achieves the best perfor-\\nmance. As mentioned in the introduction, the design of GPEFT\\naims to provide a high-quality, lightweight framework suitable for\\nvarious applications on different text-rich graphs. Considering the\\nreduced parameter storage requirements and the training time, we\\nbelieve GPEFT holds significant potential for industrial-scale ap-\\nplications, including recommendation systems, ranking tasks, and\\netc.\\nRQ5: What is the parameter sensitivity of GPEFT ?\\nThere are several important hyper-parameters in GPEFT : (1)\\nLORA rank 𝑟, it affects the number of trainable parameters (2)\\nnumber of hops 𝑘in GNN prompt encoder, it affects the amount of\\nstructural information used in the training of GPEFT .

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated re-\\nmarkable abilities in understanding text, which also introduced the\\npotential for more expressive modeling in text-rich graphs. Despite\\nthese capabilities, efficiently applying LLMs to representation learn-\\ning on graphs presents significant challenges. Recently, parameter-\\nefficient fine-tuning methods for LLMs have enabled efficient new\\ntask generalization with minimal time and memory consumption.\\nInspired by this, we introduce Graph-aware Parameter-Efficient\\nFine-Tuning - GPEFT , a novel approach for efficient graph repre-\\nsentation learning with LLMs on text-rich graphs. Specifically, we\\nutilize a graph neural network (GNN) to encode structural infor-\\nmation from neighboring nodes into a graph prompt. This prompt\\nis then inserted at the beginning of the text sequence. To improve\\nthe quality of graph prompts, we pre-trained the GNN to assist the\\nfrozen LLM in predicting the next token in the node text. Compared\\nwith existing joint GNN and LMs, our method directly generate the\\nnode embeddings from large language models with an affordable\\nfine-tuning cost. We validate our approach through comprehen-\\nsive experiments conducted on 8 different text-rich graphs, observ-\\ning an average improvement of 2% in hit@1 and Mean Reciprocal\\nRank (MRR) in link prediction evaluations. Our results demonstrate\\nthe efficacy and efficiency of our model, showing that it can be\\nsmoothly integrated with various large language models, including\\nOPT, LLaMA and Falcon.\\n∗Work done while being an intern at Amazon.\\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\\nfor profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\\non the first page.

Many of these networks are rich in\\ntextual information on various types of objects, known as text-rich\\nor text-attributed networks. For example, in an e-commerce graph,\\ntext-rich information could be used to predict links by analyzing\\nproduct descriptions, user reviews, and metadata to recommend\\nitems that are frequently bought together. Such real-world applica-\\ntions typify the problem of link prediction, where representation\\nlearning ( i.e., embedding) emerges as the most prevalent solution.\\nRepresentation learning on graph-structured data aims to learn\\na dense vector for each node through self-supervised tasks such as\\nlink prediction [ 9,34,46] or masked attribute recovery [ 14]. These\\ndense vectors can be widely utilized in various downstream ap-\\nplications including search, ranking and retrieval. To effectively\\nutilize both node attributes and structural information in represen-\\ntation learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [ 11,21] devise a\\nnovel type of neural networks with message-passing mechanism.\\nIn text-rich graphs, raw text is usually transformed into feature\\nvectors by a text encoder prior to the application of Graph Neu-\\nral Networks (GNNs). Early text encoders, such as bag-of-words\\nand Word2Vec[ 32] , are being gradually phased out due to signifi-\\ncant improvements in text representation from transformer-based\\nlanguage models (LMs).\\nThis has spurred interest in jointly modeling textual and struc-\\ntural data with GNNs and LMs. Notable architectures include (1)\\na cascading architecture that integrates GNNs with LM features\\n(cascading GNN-LMs); (2) nested GNN-LMs that blend message\\npassing into the language modeling process. Examples of the latterarXiv:2404.18271v1  [cs.CL]  28 Apr 2024', metadata={'source': './prof_1/2404.18271v1.pdf', 'page': 0})]"

In addition, GraphForm-\\ners also reports subpar performance against GNN (PEFT-LLaMA).\\nTherefore, we conclude that large language models serve as power-\\nful feature encoders for representation learning on text-rich graphs.\\nMeanwhile, InstructGLM outperforms GraphFormers but falls short\\nof PATTON’s performance. This discrepancy may be attributed to\\nthe challenges of handling graph structures through embedding-\\nbased in-context learning, which struggles with accurately cap-\\nturing structures via natural language descriptions. Consequently,\\ncarefully fine-tuned GNN-LMs ( GPEFT and PATTON) tend to sur-\\npass the embeddings produced by black-box LLMs.\\n(3)GPEFT consistently outperforms the compared baseline across\\nboth metrics. Specifically, it surpasses PEFT-LLaMA by 2.6% and\\n1.8% on MAG and Amazon Reviews, respectively, in terms of hit@1.\\nCompared to its own ablation, we find that pre-training helps im-\\nprove the accuracy of link prediction, especially in the academic\\ntext-rich graph.\\nRQ2: Is the pre-training of the graph prompt encoder neces-\\nsary?\\nOn MAG, we observe that our approach performs significantly\\nworse (∼6%) without pretraining compared to its pretrained coun-\\nterpart. On Amazon Review, while the performance gap is smaller\\nacross three subdomains, the Video Games category demonstrates\\ninstability without pretraining. Interestingly, Patton also outper-\\nforms GraphFormers with the same architecture on subdomains\\nthat utilize pre-trained checkpoints. Both methods introduce virtual\\nstructural tokens, and employing the same pre-training objective\\nas the pre-trained language model. Apparently, continual training\\nhelps align the virtual token representations with text representa-\\ntions. Therefore, we advocate for a pre-training then fine-tuning\\nparadigm, where one needs to pre-train only once in a domain and\\ncan fine-tune for various applications ( e.g., co-purchase, churn, etc.).\\n5.5 Model Analysis\\nIn this section, we provide more in-depth study to understand\\nperformance and efficiency of GPEFT .\\nRQ3:Can our approach be adapted to different PEFT methods\\nand LLMs?\\n(a) Varying PEFT algorithms\\n (b) Varying backbone LLMs\\nFigure 3: GPEFT using different LLMs and PEFT algorithms\\non Amazon Review.\\nWe first apply prefix tuning [ 24] onGPEFT and demonstrate the\\nresults on four subdomains of Amazon Review in Figure 3a. We\\ncan find that using prefix-tuning or LORA does not show muchTable 5: Time and memory costs of GPEFT on MAG-\\nEconomics using 8 A100 GPUs with a total batch size of 32.\\npre-training fine-tuning inference\\nTime 36min 96min 11min\\nMemory 20883MB 28309MB 13676MB\\n#trainable 5.5M 14.4M -\\ndifference, which indicates the versatility of our framework on\\nvarious PEFT techniques.\\nSecond, we substitute the backbone language model with OPT-\\n1.3B [ 47] and Falcon-7B2. In Figure 3b, we observe that, in general,\\nLLaMA-7B outperforms the others, with Falcon-7B in second place\\nand OPT-1.3B being outperformed by these two models. Our re-\\nsults are consistent with other work that shows LLMs with more\\nparameters yield better performance in downstream applications.\\nRQ4: Is GPEFT efficient in large-scale representation learn-\\ning?\\nIn Table 5, we report the running time of our approach at each\\nphase on MAG-Economics. Specifically, unlike the pre-training\\ntime of PATTON [ 19] (10hr+), the pre-training time of GPEFT is\\neven shorter than the fine-tuning time. Because we only optimize\\nΘ𝑔in the pre-training phase and we can say that the pre-training\\nis both necessary and efficient together with RQ2 . Owing to its\\nparameter-efficient tuning, our approach not only minimizes the\\nnumber of training parameters but also achieves the best perfor-\\nmance. As mentioned in the introduction, the design of GPEFT\\naims to provide a high-quality, lightweight framework suitable for\\nvarious applications on different text-rich graphs. Considering the\\nreduced parameter storage requirements and the training time, we\\nbelieve GPEFT holds significant potential for industrial-scale ap-\\nplications, including recommendation systems, ranking tasks, and\\netc.\\nRQ5: What is the parameter sensitivity of GPEFT ?\\nThere are several important hyper-parameters in GPEFT : (1)\\nLORA rank 𝑟, it affects the number of trainable parameters (2)\\nnumber of hops 𝑘in GNN prompt encoder, it affects the amount of\\nstructural information used in the training of GPEFT . In Figure 4,\\nwe observe that varying the rank of LoRA matrices from 4 to 32 does\\nnot significantly affect the performance. This observation aligns\\nwith findings from other studies, which suggest that optimizing for\\na single task requires only minor adjustments to the pre-trained\\nLLM weights. Similarly, varying number of hops in the GNN prompt\\nencoder has a minor effect on performance, until the point where\\nmessage passing begins to aggregate more noisy neighbors than\\nuseful ones (e.g., at 4 hops, as shown in Figure 4b).\\n6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\\nThis paper proposes GPEFT to harness LLMs for representation\\nlearning on text-rich graphs. Compared with existing work of ap-\\nplying LLM on graph structure data, our proposed method is the\\nfirst one that generates embeddings from the LLM and therefore can\\nbe applied on numerous industrial applications.

      "The paper proposes a novel approach called Graph Prompt Encoder and Fine-tuned LM (GPEFT) that leverages large language models (LLMs) for representation learning on text-rich graphs. The key innovation of GPEFT is the use of a graph neural network (GNN) to encode structural information from neighboring nodes into a graph prompt, which is then fine-tuned with an LLM to learn high-quality representations for downstream tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed approach consists of two main components:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Graph Prompt Encoder (GPE): This component is responsible for encoding the structural information from the input graph into a compact representation, called the graph prompt. The GPE uses a GNN to model the relationships between nodes in the graph and generates a set of embeddings that capture the structural information.\n",
      "2. Fine-tuned LLM (FLLM): This component is responsible for fine-tuning the LLM with the generated graph prompt to learn high-quality representations for downstream tasks. The FLLM uses the pre-trained LLM as a starting point and adapts it to the specific task at hand through a process of fine-tuning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper evaluates the performance of GPEFT on several benchmark datasets and compares it with existing approaches that apply LLMs directly to graph structure data. The results show that GPEFT outperforms these existing approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness in leveraging LLMs for representation learning on text-rich graphs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Future work could focus on exploring other architectures and techniques for incorporating structural information into the prompt encoder, such as using attention mechanisms to weight the importance of different nodes or edges in the graph, or developing more sophisticated GNN models that can capture complex patterns in the data. Additionally, there is potential to apply GPEFT to other domains beyond text-rich graphs, such as images or videos, where the structural information can be used to improve the performance of LLMs in downstream tasks.\n"
